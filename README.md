################

This lab is entended to test NetApp Ansible modules.
The variables used in this repo correspond to following NetApp Lab on Demand:
   - "Using NetApp with Docker and Kubernetes v2.0"
   - "Using Trident with Kubernetes and ONTAP v3.1"

The playbooks you are about to run use the NetApp Collection available on Ansible Galaxy.
This lab has been tested & validated with v19.11.0.

The goal here is to create & configure a tenant (ie a SVM) on the ONTAP cluster, and mounts resources on several servers.

Scenarios
---------
1. Use Ansible as simple Docker Container
2. Use Ansible as a Docker Container, which mounts a persistent volume with Trident for Docker
   - Create & Mount 2 NFS volumes on 3 hosts
   - Create & Mount NFS volumes & iSCSI LUNs on 3 hosts
   - Create, Mount & Mirror 2 NFS volumes 
3. Use Ansible as a Kubernetes App with a PVC to host these playbooks
   - Create & Mount 2 NFS volumes on 3 hosts
   - Create & Mount NFS volumes & iSCSI LUNs on 3 hosts
   - Create, Mount & Mirror 2 NFS volumes
